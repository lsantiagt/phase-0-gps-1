What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  Mostly the flow and muscle-memory of how and when to do what!
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  I think we figured out the difference between "fetch/merge" and "pull" ("pull" accomplishes both "fetch" and "merge" with one command). And got good practice applying version control in the more complex and realistic situation of working in a team with another person.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  I asked Sara about how often to commit vs. push, and the answer seemed to be "it's personal," but that you should make lots of commits and can push when you're ready to backup your work for the day or at a similar larger stopping point.
What still confuses you about Git?
  Best practices for grouping changes into a coherent commit.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  There felt like some inevitable awkwardness as we found our way through the assignment and the new experience of pairing. But it was fun to use the screenshare and change driver/navigator roles, and figure things out with another person. Thanks Luis!
